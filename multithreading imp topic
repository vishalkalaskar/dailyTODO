1. Java Executor Services
ExecutorService is an interface in Java that provides a thread pool for executing tasks asynchronously. It helps manage threads efficiently by reusing them.
🔹 Key Methods
•	newFixedThreadPool(n): Creates a fixed number of threads.
•	newCachedThreadPool(): Creates a dynamic thread pool.
•	newSingleThreadExecutor(): Executes tasks sequentially with one thread.
•	shutdown() / shutdownNow(): Stops accepting new tasks and shuts down.
🔹 Why Use It?
✔ Efficient thread management
✔ Reduces overhead of creating/destroying threads
✔ Supports task scheduling
________________________________________
2. Producer-Consumer Problem
A classic concurrency problem where:
•	The Producer generates data and places it in a queue.
•	The Consumer retrieves and processes the data.
🔹 Solution Using BlockingQueue
Java’s BlockingQueue handles synchronization automatically. The producer waits if the queue is full, and the consumer waits if the queue is empty.
________________________________________
3. Virtual Threads (Java 21+)
Java 21 introduced Virtual Threads to improve concurrency performance.
🔹 What are Virtual Threads?
•	Lightweight threads managed by the JVM.
•	Not tied to OS threads, reducing resource consumption.
•	Useful for high-concurrency applications like web servers.
🔹 Example
try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Running in a virtual thread"));
}
________________________________________
4. Daemon Thread
A daemon thread is a low-priority background thread that terminates when all user threads finish.
🔹 Example
Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Daemon running"));
daemonThread.setDaemon(true);
daemonThread.start();
📌 Use case: Garbage Collection, background monitoring.
________________________________________
5. Fork/Join Framework
Used for parallel processing by dividing a big task into smaller sub-tasks.
🔹 Key Class: ForkJoinPool
•	Uses work-stealing: idle threads take work from busy threads.
•	Ideal for recursive algorithms (e.g., merge sort, parallel computation).
🔹 Example
ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
pool.invoke(new MyTask());
________________________________________
6. Deadlocks, Livelocks, Starvation
🔹 Deadlock: Two or more threads wait indefinitely for each other’s resources.
🔹 Livelock: Threads keep changing state but make no progress.
🔹 Starvation: A low-priority thread never gets CPU time due to high-priority threads.
📌 Avoiding Deadlocks: Use lock ordering, timeouts, or tryLock().
________________________________________
7. Basics of Concurrency and Why It Matters
🔹 Concurrency allows multiple tasks to run at the same time.
🔹 Important for performance and responsiveness, especially in multi-core processors.
📌 Challenges:
•	Race conditions (two threads modifying the same variable)
•	Deadlocks (two threads waiting on each other)
•	Thread safety (ensuring correct execution in multi-threaded code)
________________________________________
8. Creating Threads in Java
1️⃣ Extending Thread
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() { System.out.println("Thread running"); }
}
new MyThread().start();
2️⃣ Implementing Runnable (Preferred)
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() { System.out.println("Runnable running"); }
}
new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();
3️⃣ Using Callable for Results
Callable<Integer> task = () -> 42;
Future<Integer> future = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1).submit(task);
________________________________________
9. Thread Lifecycle
1️⃣ NEW → Created but not started.
2️⃣ RUNNABLE → Running or ready to run.
3️⃣ BLOCKED → Waiting for a resource (e.g., lock).
4️⃣ WAITING/TIMED_WAITING → Waiting indefinitely or for a set time.
5️⃣ TERMINATED → Execution completed.
📌 Example
Thread t = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Running"));
System.out.println(t.getState()); // NEW
t.start();
________________________________________
10. Java Memory Model (JMM)
Defines how threads interact with memory and ensures:
•	Visibility (when one thread's changes are visible to others).
•	Atomicity (operations that happen in one step).
•	Ordering (ensures correct execution order).
📌 Volatile, synchronized, and locks help enforce JMM rules.
________________________________________
11. volatile, synchronized, and Atomic
🔹 volatile: Ensures visibility of a variable across threads.
volatile boolean flag = true; 
🔹 synchronized: Prevents multiple threads from modifying shared resources simultaneously.
synchronized void method() { /* thread-safe */ }
🔹 Atomic Classes (AtomicInteger, AtomicBoolean)
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet(); // Thread-safe increment
________________________________________
12. ThreadLocal and InheritableThreadLocal
🔹 ThreadLocal: Provides thread-scoped variables. Each thread gets a separate copy.
ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 1);
threadLocal.set(5);
System.out.println(threadLocal.get()); // 5 (thread-specific)
🔹 InheritableThreadLocal: Same as ThreadLocal, but child threads inherit the parent’s value.
InheritableThreadLocal<Integer> inheritable = new InheritableThreadLocal<>();
📌 Use cases: Storing per-thread authentication data, database connections, etc.

Understanding More About Atomic Operations in Java
1. What Does "Atomic" Mean?
An atomic operation is an operation that:
•	Happens in a single step (indivisible).
•	Cannot be interrupted by other threads.
•	Ensures thread safety without requiring synchronization.
2. Why Are Atomic Operations Important?
In a multi-threaded environment, if two threads modify a shared variable simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions.
Using atomic operations ensures that updates are done safely without locks.
________________________________________
3. Atomic Classes in Java (java.util.concurrent.atomic)
Java provides atomic classes that internally use low-level CPU operations (CAS - Compare-And-Swap) for fast, thread-safe updates.
Key Atomic Classes and Their Uses
Atomic Class	Purpose
AtomicInteger	Thread-safe integer operations
AtomicLong	Thread-safe long operations
AtomicBoolean	Thread-safe boolean operations
AtomicReference<T>	Thread-safe reference object
________________________________________
4. Example Usage of Atomic Classes
Using AtomicInteger for Thread-Safe Counter
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicExample {
    private static AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + count.incrementAndGet());
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
🔹 Output (Example):
mathematica
CopyEdit
Thread-0 - 1
Thread-0 - 2
Thread-1 - 3
Thread-1 - 4
Thread-0 - 5
...
•	The incrementAndGet() method ensures that no two threads increment count at the same time.
•	No explicit locking is needed.
________________________________________
5. Compare-And-Swap (CAS) Mechanism
Atomic classes internally use CAS (Compare-And-Swap):
1️⃣ Read the current value.
2️⃣ Compare it with an expected value.
3️⃣ If they match, update it; otherwise, retry.
Example of CAS in AtomicInteger:
count.compareAndSet(5, 10); // If count == 5, set it to 10
•	If count == 5, it updates to 10.
•	Otherwise, it does nothing.
________________________________________
6. AtomicReference – Handling Objects Atomically
Sometimes, we need atomic updates to non-primitive objects.
🔹 Example Using AtomicReference<String>
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference;

public class AtomicReferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AtomicReference<String> atomicStr = new AtomicReference<>("Hello");
        
        atomicStr.compareAndSet("Hello", "World");
        System.out.println(atomicStr.get()); // Output: World
    }
}
•	The compareAndSet() method ensures atomic updates without using synchronized.
________________________________________
7. When to Use Atomic Classes?
✔ Thread-safe counters (e.g., AtomicInteger for tracking users online).
✔ Optimistic locking (avoiding explicit locks).
✔ Reference updates (AtomicReference for concurrent object updates).
________________________________________
8. Difference: AtomicInteger vs. synchronized Counter
Feature	AtomicInteger	synchronized Counter
Performance	Fast (CAS-based)	Slower (Locks involved)
Overhead	Low	High
Blocking	Non-blocking	Blocking
Thread Safety	Yes	Yes
📌 Use AtomicInteger for high-performance applications when lock contention is an issue.
________________________________________
🚀 Final Thoughts
•	Atomic operations improve performance in multi-threaded applications.
•	No explicit synchronization is needed as atomic classes use CAS for thread safety.
•	Ideal for simple counters, flags, and reference updates without the overhead of locking.
