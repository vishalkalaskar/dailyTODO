Brief Answers to Kafka Interview Questions
🔹 Basic Kafka Questions (Fundamentals)

1.What is Kafka, and why is it used?
   Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and event-driven applications. It provides high throughput, scalability, and fault tolerance.

2.What are the main components of Kafka?
   Producer: Sends data to Kafka topics.
   Topic: A logical channel where data is published.
   Partition: A topic is split into partitions for scalability.
   Broker: Kafka server that stores messages.
   Consumer: Reads messages from Kafka topics.
   Zookeeper: Manages metadata,leader election  and co-ordinationing between the borkers.

3.How does Kafka ensure high availability and fault tolerance?
   Kafka uses replication (leader-follower model) to store copies of data across multiple brokers. If a broker fails, a follower takes over.

4.What is the role of Zookeeper in Kafka?
   Zookeeper helps in broker coordination, leader election, and maintaining metadata.

5.How does Kafka handle data retention and log compaction?
   Kafka retains messages based on time (e.g., 7 days) or size (e.g., 10GB). Log compaction keeps only the latest value for a key, removing old data.

6.Explain Kafka’s publish-subscribe model.
   Kafka follows a pub-sub model, where multiple consumers can read messages from a topic independently.

7.How does Kafka achieve horizontal scalability?
   Kafka scales horizontally by partitioning topics across multiple brokers.

8.What is the difference between Kafka and traditional message queues like RabbitMQ?
  Kafka is log-based, distributed, durable, and optimized for high throughput.
  RabbitMQ is queue-based, provides message acknowledgment, and is better for low-latency messaging.

🔹 Intermediate Kafka Questions (Implementation & Configurations)
1.How do you produce and consume messages in Kafka using Java?
   Use KafkaTemplate (Spring Boot) or Kafka Java client (Producer & Consumer APIs).

2.How do Kafka partitions improve performance?
   Partitions allow parallel consumption by multiple consumers, increasing throughput.

3.What happens when a Kafka consumer crashes?
   Kafka reassigns the partition to another consumer in the consumer group.

4.How does Kafka ensure message durability and reliability?
  Replication (data is copied across brokers), acks configuration (acks=all ensures data is written to all replicas).

5.Explain Kafka’s ISR (In-Sync Replica) and how it impacts fault tolerance.
   ISR is a set of replicas that are in sync with the leader. If the leader fails, a new leader is chosen from ISR.

6.What are the different types of Kafka consumer offsets?
   Latest Offset: Reads only new messages.
   Earliest Offset: Reads all messages from the beginning.
   Committed Offset: Reads from the last committed position.

7.How can you manually commit offsets in Kafka?
   Use commitSync() or commitAsync() in the consumer to manually commit offsets.

8.Explain at-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once delivery in Kafka.

   At-most-once: No duplicate, but messages may be lost.
   At-least-once: No loss, but possible duplicates.
   Exactly-once: No loss, no duplicates (enabled via Kafka Transactions).

9.How do you monitor Kafka?
  Use Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Confluent Control Center.

10.How do you secure a Kafka cluster?
   Authentication (SSL, SASL), Authorization (ACLs), Encryption (TLS).

11.What is Kafka’s replication factor, and how does it affect data availability?
   Defines how many copies of data exist. Higher replication improves fault tolerance.

12.How do you optimize Kafka for high throughput?
  Increase batch size, compression, partitions, and use asynchronous processing.

13.How do you handle large message payloads in Kafka?
   Use message compression (gzip, snappy) or store large payloads in external storage (S3, DB) and send a reference.

14.What is the significance of consumer groups in Kafka?
  Consumer groups enable parallel processing and distribute partitions among consumers.

15.How does Kafka handle backpressure when consumers are slow?
  Kafka allows consumers to process at their own pace without dropping messages.

🔹 Advanced Kafka Questions (Real-World Scenarios)
1,Describe Kafka implementation in a project you worked on.
 Example: Order processing system with Kafka events for real-time updates.

2.How would you design an event-driven microservices system using Kafka?
  Producers publish events, Kafka brokers store events, Consumers process events asynchronously.

3.What challenges did you face while implementing Kafka?
  Common issues: Consumer lag, partition imbalance, rebalancing issues, duplicate messages.

4.How do you handle dead-letter messages (DLQ) in Kafka?
  Send failed messages to a dead-letter topic for later processing.

5.How do you implement Kafka Streams for real-time processing?
   Use Kafka Streams API to process and transform data streams.

6.Explain how to integrate Kafka with Spring Boot.
   Use spring-kafka library, configure KafkaTemplate, and create @KafkaListener.

13.What is Kafka Connect?
  A tool to stream data between Kafka and external systems like databases, cloud storage.

14.How do you implement CDC (Change Data Capture) with Kafka?
   Use Debezium to capture database changes and publish to Kafka.

15.How do you ensure data consistency in Kafka?
 Transactional messaging, schema validation, idempotent consumers.

16.Kafka Streams vs. Apache Flink?
Kafka Streams: Embedded in Kafka, lightweight.
Flink: More powerful, supports advanced real-time processing.

17.What is Kafka Schema Registry (Avro, Protobuf, JSON)?
  Ensures schema validation to prevent breaking changes.

🔹 Hands-on / Coding Questions

    Use StreamsBuilder with mapValues(), filter().

Implement manual offset handling in a Kafka consumer.
  Use commitSync() after processing each message.

Simulate consumer crash and recovery.
   Kill consumer, restart, check rebalancing.

Write a Kafka producer that handles retries.

Real-time secnario question.
1.Imagine you have a Kafka cluster with 3 brokers, and one broker fails. What will happen to the messages? How will Kafka handle this failure?
  What Happens When a Broker Fails?
Replication Mechanism:
1. Kafka uses replication to ensure data durability and fault tolerance.
Each topic has multiple partitions, and each partition has one leader and multiple followers (ISR - In-Sync Replicas).
Leader Election:
2.If the failed broker was a follower, nothing changes—Kafka continues as usual.
      If the failed broker was a leader for some partitions, Kafka will elect a new leader from the ISR using Zookeeper. Producers & Consumers Behavior:

3.Producers will automatically start sending messages to the new leader.
    Consumers will fetch data from the new leader without interruption.

4.Message Loss Possibility?
  If replication factor = 2 or 3, no message is lost because another broker has a copy.
   If replication factor = 1 (not recommended), messages on the failed broker are lost.
5. Recovery & Rebalancing:
Kafka automatically rebalances partitions among remaining brokers.
When the failed broker comes back online, it syncs with the latest data before rejoining ISR.
Key Takeaways
✔ No message loss if replication factor ≥ 2.
✔ Kafka automatically elects a new leader.
✔ Minimal downtime due to automatic failover.
✔ When broker recovers, it rejoins and resyncs data.

2.You have a Kafka topic with 5 partitions, but only 3 consumers in a consumer group. How will messages be distributed among consumers?
   Scenario: Kafka Topic with 5 Partitions and 3 Consumers in a Consumer Group
How Kafka Distributes Messages?
•	Kafka follows a partition-based parallel consumption model.
•	Each partition is assigned to only one consumer within a consumer group.
•	Consumers in the group share the partitions evenly, but not necessarily equally.
________________________________________
Partition Assignment in This Case
•	Total Partitions = 5
•	Total Consumers = 3
•	Since the number of partitions (5) is greater than the number of consumers (3), Kafka will distribute them as follows:
Partition	Assigned to Consumer
Partition 0	Consumer 1
Partition 1	Consumer 2
Partition 2	Consumer 3
Partition 3	Consumer 1
Partition 4	Consumer 2
•	Consumer 1 gets 2 partitions (P0, P3).
•	Consumer 2 gets 2 partitions (P1, P4).
•	Consumer 3 gets 1 partition (P2).
________________________________________
Key Takeaways
✔ Kafka tries to balance partitions among consumers, but some consumers may have more partitions than others.
✔ If a consumer leaves, its partitions are reassigned to remaining consumers.
✔ If a new consumer joins, partitions will be rebalanced among all consumers.
✔ If there are more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be idle.

3.Your Kafka consumer is consuming messages slower than the producer is producing them. What are the possible reasons, and how would you handle this?
Scenario: Kafka Consumer is Slower Than Producer
If the consumer is lagging, it means messages are accumulating in Kafka because the consumer can't keep up with the producer's speed.
________________________________________
Possible Reasons & Solutions
1️⃣ Consumer Processing is Too Slow
•	Reason: If each message takes too long to process, the consumer can't keep up.
•	Solution:
✅ Optimize message processing logic (use efficient algorithms).
✅ Process messages in batches instead of one by one.
✅ Offload heavy processing to asynchronous workers (thread pools, background jobs).
________________________________________
2️⃣ Not Enough Consumers in the Consumer Group
•	Reason: If only one consumer is consuming from multiple partitions, it may be overwhelmed.
•	Solution:
✅ Add more consumers to the consumer group to distribute load across multiple consumers.
✅ Ensure the number of consumers ≤ number of partitions, or some will be idle.
________________________________________
3️⃣ Consumer Polling Too Slowly
•	Reason: Kafka expects consumers to poll frequently. If polling is delayed, the consumer may get kicked out of the group.
•	Solution:
✅ Increase max.poll.records to fetch more messages per poll.
✅ Reduce max.poll.interval.ms to ensure frequent polling.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Insufficient Consumer Resources (CPU, Memory, Network)
•	Reason: If the consumer’s machine is overloaded, it can't process messages fast enough.
•	Solution:
✅ Scale the consumer horizontally (add instances).
✅ Increase CPU, RAM, and network bandwidth if needed.
________________________________________
5️⃣ Consumer is Blocked on Slow External Calls (Database, API, Disk I/O)
•	Reason: If the consumer is calling a slow API or writing to a database, it may be the bottleneck.
•	Solution:
✅ Use asynchronous processing to avoid blocking.
✅ Implement circuit breakers and caching to reduce API/database calls.
✅ Use bulk writes for databases instead of inserting one record at a time.
________________________________________
6️⃣ Producer is Sending Data Too Fast
•	Reason: If the producer is generating messages at an extremely high rate, the consumer may not keep up.
•	Solution:
✅ Introduce backpressure mechanisms to slow down the producer.
✅ Use Kafka’s throttling options to control producer rate.
________________________________________
7️⃣ Consumer is Not Committing Offsets Properly
•	Reason: If offsets are committed too frequently, it may slow down the consumer.
•	Solution:
✅ Tune enable.auto.commit and use manual offset commits wisely.
✅ Commit only after processing a batch of messages.
________________________________________
How to Monitor & Fix This Issue?
✔ Use Kafka Lag Exporter / Burrow to monitor consumer lag.
✔ Check CPU, memory, and network utilization of consumer machines.
✔ Analyze consumer logs for errors or slow processing.
✔ Optimize batch size, partitioning, and multithreading for better performance.
________________________________________
Final Takeaway
✅ Scale consumers or optimize processing based on the bottleneck.
✅ Monitor consumer lag and tune configurations for efficiency.
✅ Ensure proper offset management to prevent unnecessary slowdowns.

4.YoU need to process messages in the exact order they arrive. How would you design your Kafka consumer?
Scenario: Processing Messages in Exact Order
Kafka guarantees message order only within a single partition, so designing a consumer for strict ordering requires careful partition and consumer management.
________________________________________
Designing an Ordered Kafka Consumer
1️⃣ Use a Single Partition (If Throughput is Low)
•	Kafka preserves order within a partition, so if strict ordering is needed for all messages:
✅ Use only one partition for the topic.
✅ Single consumer reads from the partition to maintain order.
•	Downside: This limits scalability since only one consumer can process messages.
________________________________________
2️⃣ Use Partition Keys to Maintain Order
•	If throughput needs scalability, but order is still crucial for a specific entity (e.g., user orders, transactions):
✅ Partition messages by a unique key (e.g., userId, orderId).
✅ This ensures all messages related to the same entity go to the same partition, keeping order intact.
•	Downside: May lead to partition imbalance if some keys have more data than others.
________________________________________
3️⃣ Ensure Single Consumer per Partition
•	Each partition should be assigned to only one consumer at a time to maintain order.
•	Avoid consumer group rebalancing issues by tuning:
✅ Set session.timeout.ms and max.poll.interval.ms properly to prevent unnecessary rebalancing.
✅ Use static group membership (group.instance.id) to avoid frequent reassignments.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Process Messages Synchronously
•	Avoid parallel processing if order must be maintained:
✅ Consumers should process messages one by one in order of arrival.
✅ Disable multi-threading unless you manually sequence messages after processing.
•	Downside: Slower processing speed.
________________________________________
5️⃣ Use Exactly-Once Processing (If Required)
•	If strict ordering and no duplicates are required:
✅ Use Kafka Transactions (enable.idempotence=true, transactional.id).
✅ This ensures exactly-once semantics across producers and consumers.
________________________________________
Final Takeaways
✅ Use one partition for strict global order (limits scalability).
✅ Use partitioning by key for ordered processing within an entity.
✅ Ensure one consumer per partition to avoid message reordering.
✅ Process messages sequentially (avoid multi-threading).
✅ Enable Kafka transactions for exactly-once processing.

5.You have a Kafka topic that is receiving a high volume of messages, and consumers are lagging. How do you monitor and optimize Kafka performance?
  Scenario: Kafka Topic Receiving High Volume, Consumers Lagging
If consumers can't keep up with the producer, it leads to lag (messages accumulating in Kafka). To resolve this, you need to monitor Kafka performance and optimize both producers and consumers.

1️⃣ How to Monitor Kafka Performance?
A. Monitor Consumer Lag
Consumer lag = Latest offset - Consumer’s committed offset

Tools for Monitoring Lag:
✅ Kafka Lag Exporter / Burrow → Tracks consumer lag per partition.
✅ kafka-consumer-groups.sh → Check lag manually:
sh
Copy
Edit
kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server <broker> --group <consumer-group> --describe
✅ JMX Metrics (kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=UnderReplicatedPartitions)
B. Monitor Broker Health
Check CPU, Memory, and Disk usage on brokers.
Monitor Kafka logs (server.log, controller.log) for errors.
Use Prometheus + Grafana for real-time Kafka metrics.
C. Monitor Producer Performance
Check producer send rate vs. consumer processing rate.
Measure producer batch size (batch.size), compression (compression.type), and retries.
2️⃣ How to Optimize Kafka Performance?
A. Optimize Consumer Performance
✅ Increase the number of consumers in the consumer group (if partitions allow).
✅ Use multithreading inside the consumer (if order isn't required).
✅ Tune max.poll.records → Increase batch size to fetch more messages per poll.
✅ Reduce max.poll.interval.ms → Prevents consumer from being removed due to slow processing.

B. Optimize Producer Performance
✅ Enable compression (compression.type=gzip or snappy) → Reduces network load.
✅ Batch messages (batch.size & linger.ms) → Increases throughput.
✅ Tune acknowledgments (acks=1 or acks=all) → Reduces latency.

C. Optimize Kafka Cluster
✅ Increase number of partitions → Spreads load across more consumers.
✅ Tune replication (replication.factor & ISR settings) → Improves fault tolerance.
✅ Distribute partitions evenly across brokers (kafka-reassign-partitions.sh).
✅ Upgrade broker resources (CPU, RAM, Disk I/O, Network bandwidth) if overloaded.

Final Takeaways
✔ Monitor consumer lag & broker health using Kafka tools.
✔ Optimize consumer settings (max.poll.records, multithreading).
✔ Improve producer efficiency (compression, batching, acks).
✔ Scale Kafka partitions & consumers for better distribution.

6.In a production system, you notice duplicate messages being processed. What could be the reason, and how would you solve this?
 Scenario: Duplicate Messages in a Production Kafka System
In Kafka, duplicate messages can occur due to producer retries, consumer re-processing, or failures. Let’s break down the possible causes and solutions.

1️⃣ Possible Causes of Duplicate Messages
A. Producer-Side Issues
🔹 Reason: Producer retries due to network issues or broker failures.
🔹 Why? If a producer doesn’t receive an ACK, it retries, causing duplicate sends.
✅ Solution:

Enable idempotence (enable.idempotence=true) to ensure exactly-once delivery.
Use a unique key (message ID) so Kafka deduplicates messages.
Tune retries and acks=all for better reliability.
B. Consumer-Side Issues
🔹 Reason: Consumer reprocesses messages due to offset mismanagement.
🔹 Why? If a consumer fails before committing the offset, Kafka will resend messages after a restart.
✅ Solution:

Use manual offset commits (enable.auto.commit=false) and commit only after processing.
Store processed messages in a deduplication store (e.g., database or Redis).
Use idempotent processing (e.g., check if message ID exists before processing).
C. At-Least-Once Semantics
🔹 Reason: Kafka’s default at-least-once guarantees may cause reprocessing.
✅ Solution:

If required, use Kafka Transactions (transactional.id) for exactly-once semantics (EOS).
Ensure idempotent consumers (avoid duplicate writes to DB or external systems).
Final Takeaways
✔ Enable idempotence on the producer (enable.idempotence=true).
✔ Use unique keys to avoid duplicate inserts.
✔ Manage consumer offsets properly (enable.auto.commit=false, commit after processing).
✔ Use deduplication strategies (e.g., store processed message IDs in Redis/DB).
✔ Consider Kafka Transactions (transactional.id) for exactly-once processing if needed.
7.You need to increase Kafka throughput. What tuning strategies would you apply to optimize Kafka performance?
Scenario: Optimizing Kafka for High Throughput
If Kafka isn't processing messages fast enough, you need to optimize producers, brokers, and consumers.

1️⃣ Producer Optimization
A. Increase Batch Size & Reduce Latency
✅ Increase batch.size (default: 16KB) → Larger batches reduce network overhead.
✅ Set linger.ms > 0 → Introduces a small delay to collect more messages before sending.

properties
Copy
Edit
batch.size=65536  # 64 KB
linger.ms=5       # Wait 5ms before sending a batch
B. Enable Compression
✅ Use compression (compression.type=gzip or snappy) → Reduces message size & network load.

properties
Copy
Edit
compression.type=snappy
C. Optimize Acknowledgment Strategy
✅ Use acks=1 instead of acks=all for faster writes (but may risk data loss).

properties
Copy
Edit
acks=1  # Only leader acknowledgment
D. Increase Partition Count
✅ More partitions = Higher parallelism.
✅ Set partitions based on consumer count (e.g., if 10 consumers, use ≥ 10 partitions).

sh
Copy
Edit
kafka-topics.sh --alter --topic my-topic --partitions 10 --bootstrap-server <broker>
2️⃣ Broker Optimization
A. Tune I/O Performance
✅ Store Kafka logs on separate high-speed disks (SSD or NVMe).
✅ Set log.segment.bytes (e.g., 512MB) to manage segment sizes efficiently.

properties
Copy
Edit
log.segment.bytes=536870912  # 512MB
B. Optimize Replication Settings
✅ Increase replication.factor for fault tolerance, but balance throughput.
✅ Use unclean.leader.election.enable=false to prevent data inconsistency.

C. Adjust Network & Thread Settings
✅ Increase Kafka network buffer size for faster transmission.

properties
Copy
Edit
socket.send.buffer.bytes=102400000
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400000
num.network.threads=8
num.io.threads=16
3️⃣ Consumer Optimization
A. Increase Consumer Parallelism
✅ Add more consumers in the consumer group.
✅ Ensure num.partitions >= num.consumers for full parallelism.

B. Tune Fetch Size & Polling
✅ Increase fetch.max.bytes to fetch larger batches.
✅ Set max.poll.records for bulk processing.

properties
Copy
Edit
fetch.max.bytes=10485760  # 10MB
max.poll.records=500
Final Takeaways
✔ Optimize producer batching & compression for efficient writes.
✔ Increase partitions & parallel consumers for better distribution.
✔ Use high-performance storage & network tuning for brokers.
✔ Adjust consumer polling & fetch size for faster consumption.

8.Your Kafka consumer is receiving messages out of order. What could be the reason, and how would you fix it?
Scenario: Kafka Consumer Receiving Messages Out of Order
Kafka preserves order within a partition, but messages may appear out of order due to misconfigured partitions, consumer parallelism, or retries.

1️⃣ Possible Reasons & Fixes
A. Multiple Partitions Assigned to a Consumer
🔹 Reason: If a consumer is reading from multiple partitions, messages from different partitions may arrive interleaved.
✅ Fix:

If global ordering is needed → Use only one partition (limits scalability).
If entity-level ordering is needed → Use partitioning key (e.g., userId, orderId) to ensure all related messages go to the same partition.
java
Copy
Edit
ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>("my-topic", userId, message);
B. Multiple Consumers in the Same Group
🔹 Reason: If there are more consumers than partitions, Kafka may rebalance and redistribute partitions, causing temporary out-of-order processing.
✅ Fix:

Ensure one consumer per partition if strict ordering is required.
Use static group membership (group.instance.id) to avoid unnecessary rebalancing.
C. Consumer Polling Too Slowly
🔹 Reason: If the consumer is slow or max.poll.interval.ms is too high, Kafka may assume it's dead and reassign its partition, causing message order disruption.
✅ Fix:

Increase max.poll.records to fetch more messages per poll.
Reduce max.poll.interval.ms to ensure frequent polling.
properties
Copy
Edit
max.poll.records=500
max.poll.interval.ms=300000  # 5 minutes
D. Message Retries or Reprocessing
🔹 Reason: If a consumer fails while processing a message, Kafka may retry from the last committed offset, causing out-of-order processing.
✅ Fix:

Use manual offset commits (enable.auto.commit=false) and commit only after successful processing.
Store processed message IDs in Redis or a database to prevent duplicate handling.
java
Copy
Edit
consumer.commitSync(Collections.singletonMap(partition, new OffsetAndMetadata(offset + 1)));
E. Parallel Processing in the Consumer
🔹 Reason: If you’re using multi-threading inside a consumer, messages may be processed in parallel, causing order issues.
✅ Fix:

Process messages sequentially if order is required.
If multi-threading is necessary, use in-memory queues to reorder messages after processing.
Final Takeaways
✔ Use partitioning keys to maintain order within partitions.
✔ Ensure one consumer per partition to avoid interleaving messages.
✔ Tune polling settings (max.poll.records, max.poll.interval.ms) to prevent rebalancing.
✔ Use manual offset commits to avoid message reprocessing.
✔ Avoid multi-threaded consumers or use in-memory queues for reordering.

9.How would you handle schema evolution in Kafka messages while ensuring backward compatibility?
  Handling Schema Evolution in Kafka (Backward Compatibility)
Schema evolution ensures that new producers and consumers can work with old messages without breaking compatibility. The best way to manage this in Kafka is using Avro, Protobuf, or JSON Schema with Schema Registry.

1️⃣ Use Schema Registry for Versioning
Apache Avro + Confluent Schema Registry is a common approach.
Producers and consumers store and retrieve schemas from the Schema Registry, ensuring compatibility.
Schema Registry tracks schema versions and enforces compatibility rules.
2️⃣ Choose a Compatibility Mode
🔹 Backward Compatibility (Recommended ✅)
New consumers can read old messages.
You can only add new optional fields, but cannot remove or modify existing ones.
✅ Allowed Changes:
✔ Add new fields with a default value.
✔ Add new fields as optional.

❌ Not Allowed Changes:
❌ Remove existing fields.
❌ Change data types of existing fields.

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "User",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "id", "type": "int" },
    { "name": "name", "type": "string" },
    { "name": "email", "type": ["null", "string"], "default": null }  // Added field (Optional)
  ]
}
🔹 Forward Compatibility
Old consumers can read new messages.
You can only remove fields, but not add new ones.
🔹 Full Compatibility
Both old and new consumers can process messages.
Only additive changes are allowed (new optional fields).
3️⃣ Implement Schema Evolution in Kafka
A. Producer: Register & Validate Schema Before Sending Messages
java
Copy
Edit
KafkaProducer<String, GenericRecord> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
SchemaRegistryClient schemaRegistry = new CachedSchemaRegistryClient("<schema-registry-url>", 10);
Schema schema = new Schema.Parser().parse(schemaRegistry.getLatestSchemaMetadata("user-value").getSchema());

GenericRecord userRecord = new GenericData.Record(schema);
userRecord.put("id", 123);
userRecord.put("name", "Alice");
userRecord.put("email", "alice@example.com");  // New optional field

ProducerRecord<String, GenericRecord> record = new ProducerRecord<>("users", "123", userRecord);
producer.send(record);
B. Consumer: Deserialize Messages with Schema Registry
java
Copy
Edit
KafkaConsumer<String, GenericRecord> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
consumer.subscribe(Collections.singleton("users"));

while (true) {
    ConsumerRecords<String, GenericRecord> records = consumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
    for (ConsumerRecord<String, GenericRecord> record : records) {
        GenericRecord user = record.value();
        System.out.println("User: " + user.get("name") + ", Email: " + user.get("email"));
    }
}
4️⃣ Handling Breaking Changes
If you must remove a field or change its type, follow these steps:
✅ Create a new topic (users_v2) and update consumers gradually.
✅ Use a compatibility bridge service to transform old messages for new consumers.
✅ Migrate data from the old topic to the new one.

Final Takeaways
✔ Use Schema Registry to manage Kafka message formats.
✔ Enable Backward Compatibility to allow new consumers to read old messages.
✔ Use Avro, Protobuf, or JSON Schema for structured message validation.
✔ Avoid breaking changes by adding optional fields instead of modifying existing ones.

10.your kafka producer is sending messages, but some messages are getting lost. how would you debug and fix this issue.
  Debugging & Fixing Kafka Producer Message Loss
If some Kafka messages are getting lost, the issue could be at the producer, broker, or consumer level. Here’s how to diagnose and fix it.
________________________________________
1️⃣ Identify the Cause of Message Loss
Possible Issue	Cause	Fix
Producer not getting ACKs	acks=0 (fire-and-forget mode)	Set acks=all
Broker crashes before replication	min.insync.replicas too low	Increase min.insync.replicas
Retries not configured	Network issues or transient failures	Set retries=Integer.MAX_VALUE
Consumer not committing offsets	Consumer re-processing old messages	Enable manual offset commits
________________________________________
2️⃣ Fixing Producer-Side Issues
A. Enable Acknowledgments (acks=all)
•	Kafka may drop messages if acks=0 or acks=1 (only leader acknowledgment).
✅ Fix: Ensure all replicas acknowledge messages before considering them "written."
properties
CopyEdit
acks=all
✅ This guarantees the message is stored safely in the Kafka cluster.
________________________________________
B. Enable Retries & Idempotency
•	Network issues, broker failures, or leader elections can cause message loss.
✅ Fix:
•	Set unlimited retries (Integer.MAX_VALUE).
•	Enable idempotent producer (enable.idempotence=true) to prevent duplicates.
properties
CopyEdit
retries=2147483647  # Integer.MAX_VALUE
enable.idempotence=true
________________________________________
C. Adjust Batch & Buffer Size for High Throughput
•	If the buffer is full, Kafka drops messages due to memory pressure.
✅ Fix:
•	Increase buffer.memory and batch.size to handle more messages.
properties
CopyEdit
buffer.memory=67108864  # 64MB
batch.size=65536        # 64KB
linger.ms=5             # Add slight delay for batch efficiency
________________________________________
3️⃣ Fixing Broker-Side Issues
A. Ensure Proper Replication (min.insync.replicas)
•	If a broker fails and min.insync.replicas is too low, messages may be lost.
✅ Fix:
•	Set at least 2 in-sync replicas (min.insync.replicas=2) to tolerate failures.
properties
CopyEdit
min.insync.replicas=2
✅ This ensures at least one replica has the message before acknowledging the producer.
________________________________________
B. Check Broker Logs for Failures
Run:
sh
CopyEdit
journalctl -u kafka -n 100  # Check Kafka logs
Look for:
🚨 ERROR Leader not available
🚨 WARN Fetch request failed
If a broker is crashing, consider:
✅ Increasing heap size (KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx4G")
✅ Checking disk space & I/O bottlenecks
________________________________________
4️⃣ Fixing Consumer-Side Issues
A. Ensure Offset Commit Handling
•	If consumers don’t commit offsets, Kafka keeps resending messages, causing perceived "loss."
✅ Fix:
•	Use manual offset commits and commit only after processing.
java
CopyEdit
consumer.commitSync(Collections.singletonMap(partition, new OffsetAndMetadata(offset + 1)));
________________________________________
B. Monitor Consumer Lag
Run:
sh
CopyEdit
kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server <broker> --describe --group <consumer-group>
•	If lag is increasing, consumers are too slow.
✅ Fix: Scale up consumers or increase max.poll.records.
properties
CopyEdit
max.poll.records=500
________________________________________
Final Takeaways
