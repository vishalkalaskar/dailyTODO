1. What is Lifting State Up in React?

When two or more components need to share data, you move the state up to their common parent and pass it down as props.
👉 It helps keep a single source of truth and avoids inconsistent states.

2. What is React Context?

Context provides a way to share data globally (like theme, user info) without passing props manually at every level.
You create it using React.createContext() and access via useContext().

3. What are different ways to add CSS in React?

Inline CSS – style={{color: 'red'}}

External CSS file – import './App.css'

CSS Modules – import styles from './App.module.css'

Styled Components – using styled-components library

Tailwind / CSS-in-JS – using utility-first or dynamic styles

4. What is the use of Parcel, Vite, Webpack?

These are bundlers/build tools that compile and optimize React apps.

Webpack – powerful, configurable bundler.

Parcel – zero-config bundler, fast build time.

Vite – lightning-fast dev server using ES modules and Rollup for build.

5. How does create-react-app work?

It uses Webpack + Babel internally to:

Bundle your React code

Transpile JSX → JS

Start a local dev server

Optimize production build automatically

6. What is Tree Shaking?

It’s a dead code elimination technique that removes unused code during build, reducing bundle size.

7. Difference between dependency and devDependency

dependencies → required in production (e.g., React, Axios)

devDependencies → used only during development (e.g., Jest, Babel)

8. What is npx and npm?

npm (Node Package Manager) → installs packages globally or locally.

npx → runs packages without installing them globally (e.g., npx create-react-app).

9. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json

package.json → lists dependencies and project metadata.

package-lock.json → locks exact versions to ensure consistent installs.

10. Difference between console.log(<HeaderComponent/>) and console.log(HeaderComponent)

console.log(<HeaderComponent/>) → logs React element (JSX)

console.log(HeaderComponent) → logs component function/class definition itself.

11. What is React.Fragment?

A wrapper component (<React.Fragment> or <> </>) used to group elements without adding extra DOM nodes.

12. What is the purpose of dependency array in useEffect()?

It tells React when to re-run the effect:

[] → runs once (on mount).

[state] → runs whenever state changes.

No array → runs on every render.

13. What if 2 components are given — will state change in one affect the other?

No, unless they share the same state (via props, context, or lifted state). Each component has its own isolated state.

14. What is the use of return in useEffect()?

Used for cleanup (like removing listeners, canceling API calls).
Example:

useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(...);
  return () => clearInterval(id); // cleanup
}, []);

15. Difference between Client-Side Routing and Server-Side Routing

Client-Side: Browser doesn’t reload, handled by React Router, faster transitions.

Server-Side: Every route loads a new HTML page from the server.

16. Explain Code Splitting and its Benefits

Code splitting means breaking code into smaller bundles using React.lazy() and Suspense.
✅ Benefits: Faster load time, better performance.

17. How does React handle Routing and Navigation?

React uses React Router library to manage routes:
<BrowserRouter>, <Route>, <Link>, etc.
It uses the History API to switch components without page reload.

18. What are Higher-Order Components (HOC)?

A function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality.
Example: withAuth(Component) adds authentication logic.

19. What are Controlled and Uncontrolled Components?

Controlled: Input managed by React state (value and onChange).

Uncontrolled: Input managed by DOM itself (use ref to access).

20. Explain Reconciliation in React

It’s React’s process of comparing the virtual DOM with previous one (diffing) and updating only the changed parts in the real DOM for performance.
